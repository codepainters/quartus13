# Altera Quartus 13.0SP1 dockerized 

Files in this repository allow for running Quartus 13.0 Service Pack 1 in a Docker container. 

Why would anyone want to run such an old release? It was the last version to support Cyclone, Cyclone-II, as well as MAX7000 families.

Not: it's a **work-in-progress**.
